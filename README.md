# EDA-and-LinReg-project-001
In this project, I explore a weather data set from Szeged, Hungary, that contains hourly and daily summaries of various meteorological variables from 2006 to 2016.  My goal is to perform some exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and linear regression on this data set.
